# Deploy — `wdl deploy` reference

## What it is

`wdl deploy <dir>` bundles a Cloudflare Workers-style project with
`wrangler deploy --dry-run`, then pushes the output to the WDL control plane.
**It is not the same as `wrangler deploy`**, which talks directly to Cloudflare.
Do **not** use `wrangler deploy` on this platform — only `wdl deploy`.

Wrangler resolution order is `WDL_WRANGLER_BIN`, the Worker project's local
wrangler, the CLI package's local wrangler, then `PATH`. By default there is no
transient `npx --yes wrangler` fetch; that fallback is allowed only when
`WDL_ALLOW_NPX_WRANGLER=1` is set.

## CLI invocation forms

Pick one in this order:

1. **`command -v wdl` succeeds** — installed globally (`npm i -g @wdl-dev/cli`).
   Use `wdl ...` directly.
2. **Developing inside the wdl-cli repo** (`<repo>/bin/wdl.js` exists) — use
   `node <repo>/bin/wdl.js ...`. This is the development scenario.
3. **Neither** — stop and tell the user; do not invent a path.

In the examples below, treat `wdl` as a placeholder and substitute the form you
resolved.

## Credentials — one-time setup

The CLI needs three values:

| Value         | Purpose                                                                                                                            |
| ------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `ADMIN_TOKEN` | Tenant deploy token. **Sensitive** — never paste it into chat or commit history.                                                   |
| `WDL_NS`      | Tenant namespace, e.g. `acme`, `demo-prod`.                                                                                        |
| `CONTROL_URL` | Control-plane URL — from your operator, or your own self-hosted platform (e.g. `https://api.wdl.dev`). The CLI has no built-in default; it must be configured. |

**Recommended path:** `wdl token set --ns <ns> --control-url <url>` reads the
token at a hidden prompt, validates it against `/whoami`, and stores it `0600` in
`~/.config/wdl/credentials` — so it never lands in a project file or shell
history. The first stored namespace becomes the default, so later `wdl deploy`
needs no `--ns`. One store serves every project on the machine; see
[token.md](./token.md).

**Per-repo alternative:** when a project should carry its own control URL /
namespace, copy `.env.example` to `.env` and fill in the `[<ns>]` section (the
committed `.env.example` also documents the shape for teammates). The CLI reads
only `./.env` from the directory you run `wdl` in (there is no upward search), so
run `wdl` from the directory that holds it. The token stays in the gitignored
`.env`, never committed.

**CI / automation:** inject `ADMIN_TOKEN`, `CONTROL_URL`, and `WDL_NS` as
environment variables from your CI secret store — not the interactive token
store, and never a committed `.env`.

Bare control hosts get a scheme automatically; production hosts default to
`https://`, local `.test` / `.local` or `:8080` hosts default to `http://`. To
force a protocol, write `https://...` or `http://...` explicitly.

Precedence: `CLI flag > shell env > .env [<ns>] section > .env base section > wdl
token store`. If none supplies a value, the command fails — there is no built-in
default.

**Untrusted projects:** `wdl deploy` runs the project's local Wrangler dry-run
and build hooks as your OS user, so that code can read the on-disk token store
(the credential scrub only keeps WDL variables out of the Wrangler child's
environment, not out of the file). Only deploy projects you trust. For an
untrusted or third-party project, pass an ephemeral `--token` / `--control-url`
plus `--no-token-store` (or `WDL_TOKEN_STORE=off`) so the CLI ignores the store —
and don't keep a global store at all, since the flag opts out of *reading* the
file, not its presence on disk. See [token.md](./token.md).

When unsure which value won, run `wdl config explain`; to confirm which control
the token actually reaches, plus the principal, platform version, and URL hints,
run `wdl whoami`; for baseline local and remote diagnostics, run `wdl doctor`.
When the control plane supports `/whoami`, `doctor` verifies the remote token,
principal namespace, platform version, and CLI compatibility. Use
`wdl doctor --strict` in CI when a failed check should make the job fail.

For runtime secrets (distinct from `ADMIN_TOKEN`), see
[secrets.md](./secrets.md).

## Worker URL shape

```
https://<namespace>.<platform-domain>/<worker-name>/<path>
```

The Worker sees the path **with the `/<worker-name>` prefix stripped**. Tenants
have no custom routing capability unless the operator explicitly enables it; do
not add `route` / `routes` in a first-time setup.

## Core commands

| Goal                       | Command                                                   |
| -------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| Deploy a project           | `wdl deploy <dir> [--ns <ns>] [--env <name>] [--verbose]` |
| List workers               | `wdl workers`                                             |
| Live-tail worker logs      | `wdl tail <worker> [--raw]`                               |
| Delete a non-live version  | `wdl delete version <worker> <vN>`                        |
| Delete a worker (preview)  | `wdl delete worker <worker> --dry-run`                    |
| Inspect Workflow instances | `wdl workflows instances <worker> <workflow>`             |

`--ns` is optional whenever `WDL_NS` is set via env or `.env`, or the `wdl token`
store has a default namespace. Every subcommand implements `--help` — run it when
you don't know which flag to use.

## Standard deploy flow

1. **Resolve the CLI invocation form** (above).
2. **Resolve credentials** — for a trusted project, prefer `.env` or the `wdl
   token` store; do not inline environment variables. For an untrusted or
   third-party project, use an ephemeral `--token` / `--control-url` with
   `--no-token-store` instead (see Credentials above — deploy runs project code
   as you).
3. **Wrangler version check.** The bundling step requires `wrangler@^4`. If the
   project pins v3, stop and tell the user — do not silently upgrade.
4. **Install worker dependencies** (`npm install` in the worker directory) if
   `node_modules` is missing.
5. **Pre-create persistent bindings.** Read the wrangler config:
   - `[[d1_databases]]` → for each `database_name`, check with `wdl d1 list`
     first; create missing ones with `wdl d1 create <name>`. See
     [d1.md](./d1.md).
   - `[[r2_buckets]]` and `[[kv_namespaces]]` are lazy — no pre-creation needed;
     the binding works on first use. See [r2.md](./r2.md) and [kv.md](./kv.md).
   - `[[queues.*]]` — see [queues.md](./queues.md); when queue ownership is
     unclear, confirm with the operator.
6. **Apply D1 migrations** if `migrations_dir` is set — see [d1.md](./d1.md).
7. **Deploy:** `wdl deploy .`. The CLI prints the upload, the promote, and the
   runtime URL — show that URL to the user.

The manifest JSON that deploy uploads to control is capped at 32 MiB. Assets are
embedded in that JSON request at deploy time; a large static file set can hit
the control request cap first. Put bulk or frequently changing files in R2, not
in assets.

The control plane enforces a headroomed 1 MiB workerd `workerLoader` environment
budget (1,040,384 bytes usable). Large `[vars]`, secrets, binding metadata, or
retained versions can fail with `worker_env_too_large`; reduce the env payload,
or redeploy/delete the retained version named in the error when one is shown.

## Environment overrides

When the wrangler config has `[env.<name>]` sections, `--env <name>` (or
`CLOUDFLARE_ENV`) is **required** — the CLI does not pick a default for you. Be
explicit:

```bash
wdl deploy . --env preview
wdl deploy . --env production
```

The deployed worker name always comes from the top-level `name`, with no
environment suffix. Wrangler / Cloudflare Workers `--env` may lead you to expect
names like `my-worker-preview`; WDL does not append that suffix. See
[env-overrides.md](./env-overrides.md) for the config shape.

## Supported / unsupported wrangler configuration

When multiple Wrangler config files exist, the CLI follows Wrangler's priority:
`wrangler.json`, then `wrangler.jsonc`, then `wrangler.toml`.
Both JSON filenames use Wrangler's JSONC syntax, including comments and
trailing commas.

**Supported:** `name`, `main`, `compatibility_date` / `compatibility_flags`, `[vars]`,
`[[kv_namespaces]]`, `[[d1_databases]]`, `[[durable_objects.bindings]]`,
`[[workflows]]`, `[[r2_buckets]]`, `[assets] directory`, `[triggers] crons`,
`[[triggers.schedules]]` (with timezone, a platform extension),
`[[queues.producers]]` / `[[queues.consumers]]`, `[[services]]`,
`[[platform_bindings]]`, `[[exports]]`, `[env.<name>]`.

**Unsupported (deploy fails):** Analytics Engine. Durable Objects supports
same-worker classes only; `script_name` and rename/delete migrations are not
implemented yet. WDL Workflows supports only workflow classes defined in the
current Worker — not full Cloudflare Workflows parity; `script_name`,
cross-worker workflows, cross-worker callbacks, service-binding callbacks, and
the Cloudflare source-AST visualizer are not supported. `route` / `routes` are
supported only when the operator enables them. Python Workers modules, workerd
experimental compatibility flags, and WDL-reserved injected module names are
rejected during deploy: the CLI fails fast on local `.py` modules, and the
control plane is canonical for workerd compatibility and bundle-shape policy.
Top-level or selected-environment Wrangler runtime/deploy config fields and
sections that WDL would otherwise ignore are also rejected by the CLI, including
legacy `[site]` Workers Sites, `workers_dev`, `pages_build_output_dir`,
`observability`, `limits`, `placement`, and other unsupported binding/config
fields or sections named in the error.
`assets.run_worker_first` is silently ignored.

Cron triggers and queue consumers are runtime dispatch features; declare them
only on routeable tenant Workers. Workers selected through
`[[platform_bindings]]` are cold-loaded platform capabilities, not
public/runtime dispatch targets, and cannot declare cron triggers or queue
consumers.

## Destructive commands

`wdl delete worker`, `wdl delete version`, `wdl d1 delete`, and
`wdl secret delete` prompt for confirmation by default. If `--dry-run` exists,
run it first (or do a read-only check), then add `--yes` only after confirming
with the user. Do **not** add `--yes` on your own.

Deleting a worker does **not** delete R2 data — see [r2.md](./r2.md).

## Common errors

| `Missing admin token`                                            | No token resolved. Run `wdl token set --ns <ns> --control-url <url>` (recommended), or set `ADMIN_TOKEN` / pass `--token` / use the `[<ns>]` section of `.env`.                         |
| `401 unknown_token: unauthorized`                                | The token is invalid for this control plane / namespace. Re-check `ADMIN_TOKEN`.                                     |

| `[vars] <NAME>: only string/number/boolean values are supported` | Remove nested values; move sensitive strings to a secret.                                                            |
| `binding name collision: <NAME>`                                 | `[vars]`, explicit bindings, or the implicit `ASSETS` binding reused a runtime env name. Rename one of them.        |
| `experimental_compat_flag_unsupported`                           | Remove the experimental workerd compatibility flag.                                                                  |
| `python_workers_unsupported`                                     | Python Workers are not supported by WDL; remove Python Worker modules. The CLI also fails fast on local `.py` modules. |
| `worker_env_too_large`                                           | Reduce `[vars]`, secrets, or binding metadata; redeploy/delete any retained version named in the error.              |
| `worker_code_too_large`                                          | Reduce generated Worker code size or split the worker.                                                               |
| `worker_code_invalid`                                            | Fix the Worker bundle shape reported by the control plane, including WDL-reserved injected module names.             |
| `wrangler build failed`                                          | Run `npx wrangler deploy --dry-run` inside the project and fix it there.                                             |
| Deploy succeeds but promote fails                                | Custom host or service-binding target validation issue; check the binding targets.                                   |
| Worker URL returns 404                                           | The URL is missing the `/<worker-name>` segment.                                                                     |

| `tail session_idle` / `tail session_expired`                     | Control reclaimed the live-tail stream; the CLI reconnects automatically unless the reconnect cap is reached.        |
| Namespace secret did not take effect                             | NS-level secrets do not force-bump workers; redeploy once or use a worker-level secret.                              |
| Service binding still hits the old target                        | Bindings are pinned at caller deploy time; redeploy the caller.                                                      |

## Anti-patterns

- ❌ Running `wrangler deploy` on this platform. It talks to Cloudflare, not
  WDL. Use `wdl deploy`.
- ❌ Committing a `.env` file containing `ADMIN_TOKEN` to git.
- ❌ Adding Durable Objects / Workflows config "just in case" — they change the
  runtime entrypoint and deploy validation; add them only when the code actually
  uses them.
- ❌ Pinning `wrangler` to `^3`. The bundling step requires v4.

## End-to-end examples

Every example under `../examples/<name>` is a deployable project.
`../examples/hello-jsonc` is the smallest.
